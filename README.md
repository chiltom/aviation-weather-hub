# The Aviation Weather Hub

This is the aviation weather hub, a service for aircrew weather forecasters to enhance their forecast abilities and optimize their daily workflow.

## Purpose

Forecasting and briefing is a hard job as it is. When flight-related data is scattered across the internet amongst many different services with no consolidation points, it makes the job even harder. This application aims to consolidate much of this data while providing a personalized task management system to meet your specific needs.
