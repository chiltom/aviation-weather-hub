> What Services Do We Provide and How?

Flight data and information for an organization must be stored with the highest level of security. This application uses HTTP-Only Cookie Authentication and is served with an HTTPS SSL certificate to securely store your session data and credentials and ensure that cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are mitigated and your data is safe.

The workflow portion of the application involves storing a forecaster's favorite airports and locations to the workflow page, and being able to pull the latest METAR or TAF data for them. This portion also holds a forecaster's personal lists and tasks for each shift that they may want to store for later use. This is extremely helpful due to the various tasks and issues that a forecaster is responsible for throughout their shifts. 

The flights portion of the application involves storing all of the flight and brief data for a forecaster's flights that they are responsible for briefing. The formats and relevant fields are all described in detail in the page.

There are many more features that will be implemented in the future to consolidate more essential data to this site, such as a map with satellite, radar, and precipitation layers, as well as a training page to train junior forecasters eager to get on the desk and start briefing.
